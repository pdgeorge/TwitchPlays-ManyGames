# TwitchPlays
This code is originally based off Wituz's Twitch Plays template, then expanded by DougDoug and DDarknut with help from Ottomated for the Youtube side.

As is tradition with Python projects, use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required packages.

A template example is shown in the games folder, where more games will be loaded over time, where I will be playing with chat and adding the code for the games there for fast loading/reference in the future.
